2. [30] Short answer questions about your program in Problem 1:
a. [5] What is the meaning of const after a member function prototype?
b. [5] What happens if you use the default copy constructor for Vector?
c. [5] What happens if you use the default assignment operator for Vector?
d. [5] Why pass Vector by reference but make it const as with operator *?
e. [5] Why are operators *, +, and << friends and not member functions?
f. [5] Why does operator [] return a T & as opposed to a T?

a. It means that objects called by these functions cannot be modified.

b. The default copy constructor will only use shallow copy.

c. The default assignment operator will point both vectors to the same data, instead of copying over and creating a new set of data.

d. We want to pass by reference because it is much faster than pass by copy and we make it const to ensure that the argument is not changed.

e. We want to call these functions outside of the class's scope while still maintaining access to the class's data members

f. So we can use the expression on the left side of the assignment operator to allow for reassigning.

1) Static

"In Simple_Scoping Initially   m = 10"
"In Q m = 6"
"In Simple_Scoping after Q   m = 12"
"In Simple_Scoping after P   m = 12"

2) Dynamic
"In Simple_Scoping Initially   m = 10"
"In Q m = 12"
"In Simple_Scoping after Q   m = 10"
"In Simple_Scoping after P   m = 12"
